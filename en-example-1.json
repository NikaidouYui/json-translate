			},
			"how_works": {
				"question": "How Does AI Baby Generator Work?",
				"answer": "AI baby generators work by using advanced algorithms to analyze uploaded photos of parents. The AI examines various facial features and blends them together to create an image of a baby that reflects the combined characteristics of both individuals."
			},
			"accuracy": {
				"question": "How Accurate is FaceMe's AI Baby Generator?",
				"answer": "FaceMe's AI baby generator claims to have an accuracy rate of up to 90%. However, it's important to remember that these predictions are based on visual similarities and artistic interpretation rather than scientific genetics. While many users report seeing resemblances, the results should be viewed as fun and speculative rather than definitive."
			},
			"photo_tips": {
				"question": "What Type of Photos Should I Upload?",
				"answer": "For the best results, upload clear, front-facing photos of both parents. Ensure that the images are well-lit and show the faces clearly. Avoid filters or obstructions that could affect the AI's ability to analyze facial features accurately."
